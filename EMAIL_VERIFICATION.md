- Returns success with verification instructions

### `GET /api/auth/verify-email?token=...`

## üõ†Ô∏è Database Schema

The email verification uses existing NextAuth tables:

```sql
-- Users table (existing)
users {
  id: UUID
  email: VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE
  emailVerified: TIMESTAMPTZ  -- NULL = unverified
  password_hash: TEXT
  name: VARCHAR(255)
  created_at: TIMESTAMPTZ
  updated_at: TIMESTAMPTZ
}

-- Verification tokens table (existing)
verification_tokens {
  identifier: VARCHAR(255)    -- User email
  token: VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE  -- Verification token
  expires: TIMESTAMPTZ        -- Expiration date
}
```

## üîí Access Control Integration

Email verification is integrated with the existing access control system:

1. **Authentication Check**: Users must be authenticated AND verified
2. **API Protection**: All API endpoints check email verification
3. **Production Enforcement**: Only verified users from ALLOWED_USERS can access
4. **Session Management**: Verification status stored in JWT tokens

## üé® Customization

### Email Templates
Edit `/src/lib/email.ts` to customize:
- Email content and styling
- Branding elements
- Call-to-action text
- Footer information

### Pages
Customize verification pages in `/src/app/auth/verify-email/`:
- `pending/page.tsx` - Check your email page
- `success/page.tsx` - Verification successful
- `error/page.tsx` - Verification failed

### Error Messages
Update error messages in:
- `/src/components/AuthForm.tsx` - Sign-in form errors
- `/src/app/api/auth/signup/route.ts` - Signup API errors

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Emails not sending**
   - Check RESEND_API_KEY is correct
   - Verify FROM_EMAIL domain is verified in Resend
   - Check Resend dashboard for delivery status

2. **Verification links not working**
   - Ensure NEXTAUTH_URL is set correctly
   - Check token hasn't expired (24 hours)
   - Verify database connectivity

3. **Users can't sign in after verification**
   - Check emailVerified field in database
   - Verify JWT token includes verification status
   - Ensure access control allows the user

### Debug Steps:

1. Check server logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify environment variables are loaded
3. Test database connection with `/api/debug`
4. Check Resend dashboard for email delivery logs

## üìà Production Considerations

1. **Domain Verification**: Verify your domain in Resend for better deliverability
2. **Email Monitoring**: Monitor bounce rates and spam reports
3. **Rate Limiting**: Consider additional rate limiting for verification requests
4. **Backup Email Service**: Have a fallback email service for critical situations
5. **Database Cleanup**: Periodically clean up expired verification tokens

## üîÑ Migration for Existing Users

If you have existing users without email verification:

1. **Option A**: Grandfather existing users (set emailVerified = NOW())
2. **Option B**: Require verification for all users
3. **Option C**: Gradual migration with grace period

Choose based on your user base and security requirements.
